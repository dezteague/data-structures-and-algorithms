## FizzBuzz Tree

Author: Deziree Teague 

Collaborator: Julie Ly

## Challenge

Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”

If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”

If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

Return the tree with its new values.

## BIG O

Time Complexity = O(n): Must traverse the whole tree

Space Compexity = O(h): Where h is the height of the tree
