## Extra Credit: Unique Characters

Author: Deziree Teague 

## Challenge

Implement a method that takes in a string and returns true of all characters are unique.  

## Approach

* Use a hashtable
* Iterate through the string
* For each character, put it in the hashset
* If the value already exists, return false
* If the value does not exist, add to the set

## BIG O

Time and space complexities are O(n) because you have to go through the length of the string and there is no extra space being created.
