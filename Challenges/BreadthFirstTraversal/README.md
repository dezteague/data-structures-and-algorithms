## FizzBuzz Tree

Author: Deziree Teague 

Collaborator: Julie Ly

## Challenge

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its input. Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach and print each nodeâ€™s value

## BIG O

Time Complexity = O(n): Must traverse the whole tree

Space Compexity = O(w): Where w is the width of the tree

## White board layout
