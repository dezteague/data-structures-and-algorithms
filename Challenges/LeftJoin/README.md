## Challenge

Create a method that left joins two hashmaps into a single data structure.  

The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.

The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to left join logic.

## BIG O

Time complexity is O(1) and space complexity is O(n).
