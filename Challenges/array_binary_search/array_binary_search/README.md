## Array Binary Search

## Author: Deziree Teague with Collaborator Blaise Clarke

## Challenge

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist

## BIG O

Time efficiency is O(logN) and memory space is O(n).
