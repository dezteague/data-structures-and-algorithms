## Find Maximum Value Binary Tree

Author: Deziree Teague 

Collaborator: Julie Ly

## Challenge

Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. Return the maximum value stored in the tree assuming that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## BIG O

Time Complexity = O(n): Must traverse the whole tree

Space Compexity = O(w): Where w is the width of the tree

## White board layout
