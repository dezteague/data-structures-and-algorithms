## Breadth First Graph

Author: Deziree Teague 

## Challenge

Implement a method called BreadthFirst which takes in a starting node and returns a collection of nodes in the order they were visited.

## BIG O

Time complexity is O(n) because each node is visited and space complexity is O(v) where v represents the number of vertices.
