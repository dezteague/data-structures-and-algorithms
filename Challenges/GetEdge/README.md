## Get Edges

Author: Deziree Teague 

## Challenge

Write a function called GetEdge, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names.  It should return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## BIG O

Time complexity is O(1) and space complexity is O(v) where v represents the number of vertices
