## FizzBuzz Tree

Author: Deziree Teague 


## Challenge

Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, conducts a depth first traversal, and returns a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## BIG O

Time Complexity = O(n): Must traverse the whole graph

Space Compexity = O(n): using list of known size

## White board layout
