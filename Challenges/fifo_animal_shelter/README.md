# FIFO Animal Shelter

Author: Deziree Teague with Collaborator Ryna Truong

## Challenge

Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach

Implement the following methods:

enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.

dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## BIG O

Enqueue: O(1) operation in time because it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

Dequeue: O(1) operation in time because you are always removing the Front node of the queue.
