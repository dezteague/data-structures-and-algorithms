# Multi-Bracket Validation

Author: Deziree Teague with collaborator Ryna Truong

## Challenge

Write a function called MultiBracketValidation which takes in string as its only argument and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()

Square Brackets : []

Curly Brackets : {}

## BIG O

Time and space are O(n) because n is the length of the string and you only push into the stack n times.
