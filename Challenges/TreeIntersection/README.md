## Tree Intersection

Author: Deziree Teague 

## Challenge

Implement a method called TreeIntersection which takes in two binary trees as parameters and returns common values.

## BIG O

Time complexity is o(n) because you go through the each node in the tree and space complexity is o(h) where h represents the height of the trees.
