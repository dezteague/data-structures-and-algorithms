## Calculate Binary Tree Height

Author: Deziree Teague 

## Challenge

Implement a method called CalculateBinaryTreeHeight which takes in the root node and outputs an integer that is the height of the tree.

## BIG O

Time Complexity = O(n): Must traverse the whole tree

Space Compexity = O(h): Where h is the height of the tree
