## Hashtables

Author: Deziree Teague

## Challenge

Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

Add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

Get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

Contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

Hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## BIG O

Add is an O(1) operation because addition occurs at a specific index and only one space in memory is created.

Get is an O(1) operation the search is based on a given index and no additional space is created.

Contains is an O(1) operation because it's based on the exists of a key in a specific index and no additional space is created.

Hash is an O(1) operation because the calcuation occurs at a specific index and no additional space is created.
