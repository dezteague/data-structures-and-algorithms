# Trees

Author: Deziree Teague

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Create a BinaryTree class that has a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

Create a BinarySearchTree class that has a method named Add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Additionally, create a method named Contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## BIG O
The Big O time of an insertion an searching in a Binary tree is O(n) because there is no structure or organization to a Binary Tree

The Big O space for a node insertion using breadth is O(w), where “w” represents the width of the tree. 

The Big O of a Binary Search Tree for insertion and search is O(log n). 

The Big O space of a Binary Search Tree is O(1) because we are not allocating any additional space.
