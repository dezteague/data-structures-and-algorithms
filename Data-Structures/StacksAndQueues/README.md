## Stacks and Queues

Author: Deziree Teague

## Challenge

Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

Create three classes: Node, Stack, and Queue

Stack Methods: Push, Pop, Peek

Queue Methods: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek

## BIG O

Push is an O(1) operation because it takes the same amount of time, no matter how many nodes you have in the stack

Pop is an O(1) operation in time because you are always removing from the top, it doesn't matter how many items are in the stack.

Enqueue is an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue, it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

Dequeue is an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are still always removing the Front node of the queue
